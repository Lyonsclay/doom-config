Test driving Doom emacs 🎏
** `doom doctor`  👜
Doom comes with a command line interface that is quite nice and enables an easy upgrade experience.
** `doom sync` 🙋🏾 
This command will add/remove packages and update all conigs.
** Migrating from spacemacs. ❇ 
I did not expect to move completely as quick as I did after first looking at doom. The UX is phenomenal and makes me an immediate fan. I see three important aspects that make this product great!
a. It looks great.
b. The configuration is well organized and facilitates uprade and down grade scenarios. I need to experience the ecosystem through some upgrades before I can't really comment on that aspect of doom. But I can say that having designated files and code patterns which separate private config and user installed packaeges from framework packages and their configs.
c. Adding go-run function.
** Live coding TODOS. 🗒
a. Add a keymap for common activity. (make vterm far right or make magit window far right)
b. Decide keys for multiple-cursors.
b. Record setup for project.
c. Test drive typescript with new pbiviz project.
d. Add :localleader mapped commands to gorepl.
   Restart go-repl.
e. PR for window-move-very-far-right

** General Assesment
Migrating to Doom has caused me to take my emacs-elisp to the next level. This is most likely a result of feature loss.

Doom promotes higher level configuration macros ->
