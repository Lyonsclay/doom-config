Test driving Doom emacs 🎏
** `doom doctor`  👜
Doom comes with a command line interface that is quite nice and enables an easy upgrade experience.
** `doom sync` 🙋🏾 
This command will add/remove packages and update all conigs.
** Migrating from spacemacs. ❇ 
I did not expect to move completely as quick as I did after first looking at doom. The UX is phenomenal and makes me an immediate fan. I see three important aspects that make this product great!
a. It looks great.
b. The configuration is well organized and facilitates uprade and down grade scenarios. I need to experience the ecosystem through some upgrades before I can't really comment on that aspect of doom. But I can say that having designated files and code patterns which separate private config and user installed packaeges from framework packages and their configs.
