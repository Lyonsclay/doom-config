0. If you use ivy(as I do) then you have to scroll by pressing C-M n or C-M p to see previous or next.

1. ibuffer - is an easy way to delete any buffer from current window.
   To delete a buffer navigate to it in the list(popup window) user j/k,
   then ender 'd' - label line for deleting. 'x' confirms deleting buffers that
   have been designated with a 'd' delete on their respective line.
   I can't figure out how to display the list of actions and keystrokes. TODO

2. clone-indirect-buffer (SPC b c) and clone-indirect-buffer-other-window (SPC b C) can create a second buffer of a particular file. I am not sure the operational difference of the two. My use case is to have two windows of the same file, but have one completely collapsed showing the function names. Note - you can achieve a similar effect by using treemacs and hitting tab. This might be usefull in setting up two database clients from the same file. I do this often when pulling data from a remote database and storing results in my own local database for further analysis.

3. treemacs-peek (P) from the treemacs window is quite nice, especially with the combination of expanding a file to show functions and types.

4. In order to preview color themes on the fly;
   (SPC h t) to get into the interactive color theme selection interface.
   (M C n) to move to the next selection and view it applied to your open windows.
   (M C p) to move to the previous selection and view it applied to your open windows.
   For normal scrolling (C n) or (C j) to move down and (C p) or (C k) to move up.

5. M-x getenv pulls up drop down of all environment variables. Once you select one it will show you the value.

6. IPython or other shell user `(setq inhibit-read-only t)` in order to edit buffer.

7. use \(\s-*\)\s- with the align-regexp command 🐈

8. In a terminal shell use (SPC k) to delete highlighted output lines.

9. In a gptel-menu use =c-m= instead of =return= to send prompt.

------------------------------
-- normal workflows

1. Copy current file path
   a. relative - (SPC f Y)
   b. absolute - (SPC f a)
2. Show current file in treemacs - (SPC o P)

-- debugging and fixing
1. Recently had an issue with a dep that introduced a bug or breaking change. As it turns out I was able to update
   emacs-plus@28 because a change was pushed that accomodates the new xref pattern. But hlissner offered this suggestion on
   discord which is a good tip in general.
The workaround: pin xref to the last known working ref: a82f459b37b31546bf274388baf8aca79e9c30d9

;; in $DOOMDIR/packages.el
(package! xref :pin "a82f459b37b31546bf274388baf8aca79e9c30d9")
